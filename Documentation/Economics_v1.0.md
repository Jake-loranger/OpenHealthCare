## Modeling Healthcare Fund Contributions Using an Arctangent Function

This document proposes an arctangent-based equation to model individual contributions to a universal healthcare fund. The goal is to ensure that total contributions exceed the healthcare costs paid out by approximately 15%. This model accounts for personal income, regional healthcare costs, and other socioeconomic factors while ensuring fairness and sustainability.

### The Equation

The proposed equation for individual contributions is:

### Variables and Parameters
- **<i>P<sub>i</sub></i>** - Individual contribution to the healthcare fund.
- **<i>I<sub>i</sub></i>** - Individual’s annual income.
- **<i>I<sub>bar</sub></i>** - Average annual income in the region.
- **<i>C<sub>i</sub></i>** - Regional average cost of healthcare.
- **<i>C<sub>bar</sub></i>** - National average cost of healthcare.
- **<i>F</i>** - Adjustment factor for other socioeconomic variables (e.g., cost of living, risk index, subsidies).
- **<i>A</i>** - Total range of contributions; determines the maximum contribution value.
- **<i>k</i>** - Scaling factor that adjusts the steepness of the arctangent curve.
- **<i>b</i>** - Horizontal shift, controlling the income threshold for increased contributions.
- **<i>C</i>** - Baseline contribution amount.
- **&beta;** - Weight applied to socioeconomic factors.

### Behavior of the Equation
1. **Sigmoidal Shape:** The arctangent function ensures that contributions grow gradually for lower incomes, increase sharply for middle-income groups, and asymptotically approach a maximum for high-income groups.
2. **Fairness and Proportionality:** Contributions are scaled based on regional healthcare costs and individual income, ensuring proportional contributions.
3. **Adjustability:** Parameters <i>k</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>A</i> can be tuned to fit real-world data and policy goals.

### Objective
The universal fund’s total contributions <i>U</i> should be approximately 15% more than the total healthcare costs <i>T</i> paid out:

![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{150}\color{White}U%20=%201.15%20\cdot%20T)


### Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Gather real-world data for:
   - Personal income distributions <i>P<sub>i</sub></i>.
   - Regional and national healthcare costs <i>C<sub>i</sub></i>, C<sub>bar</sub></i>.
   - Socioeconomic factors <i>F</i>.

2. **Parameter Estimation:** Determine initial values for <i>A</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>C</i> and &beta; using historical data.

3. **Simulation:**
   - Compute contributions <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> for a representative population sample.
   - Aggregate contributions to find <i>U</i>.
   - Compare <i>U</i> to <i>T</i> to ensure the fund contribution is 1.15 times the healthcare costs.

4. **Refinement:**
   - Adjust parameters to minimize deviation from the 15% target.
   - Ensure equitable contributions across different income brackets.

### Visualization
A plot of the equation <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> against <i>I<sub>i</sub></i> illustrates its behavior:

- **Low-Income Individuals:** Contributions approach the baseline <i>C</i>.
- **Middle-Income Individuals:** Contributions increase sharply due to the arctangent curve.
- **High-Income Individuals:** Contributions asymptotically approach <i>A + C</i>.

### Next Steps
1. Integrate this model into a larger simulation framework.
2. Validate the model using real-world data.
3. Publish findings and refine the model based on feedback from policymakers and stakeholders.

This arctangent-based approach offers a mathematically robust and adjustable method for modeling contributions to a universal healthcare fund. By aligning contributions with income and regional factors, it ensures fairness while achieving the desired funding surplus.
